Analysis of PA1 cells having 2/1/0 functional copies of DGCR8 gene.
- small RNA seq: identification of differentially expressed miRNAs
- total RNA seq: identification of differentially expressed mRNAs
- MPI: identification of differentially processed pri-miRNAs

All pipelines are work in process based on unpublished data
